# Exploratory Data Analysis and KNN Classification on Abalone Dataset

## Overview
In this project, the Abalone dataset has been used to perform exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and classification using the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
The project consists of three main sections:

## Dataset
The dataset used in the project is the Abalone dataset, which contains physical characteristics of abalone fish. The classification task involves predicting the age of the fish (represented by the "Rings" feature) based on other features. 

## Assessment of Data and Applying Normalization:

Analyzing the dataset for missing data, computing summary statistics, and exploring the distribution of features.
Determining if the dataset is balanced and applying any necessary correction.
Normalizing the data using z-score normalization.

## Classification with KNN

Training a KNN classifier with default parameters on the training set and evaluating its performance on the test set.
Exploring different values of the KNN parameter, k, by performing 5-fold cross-validation on the training set.
Compare the results obtained using simple KNN and weighted KNN.
